<p>Description:</p>
<hr>
Chimera (CMRA) is an ERC-20 token that runs privately on the Ethereum blockchain. Its main goal is to remove the transparency seen in typical Ethereum tokens, effectively eliminating transactions being logged by services such as Etherscan. This is to give token holders the advantage of staying anonymous - the wallet address of token holders cannot be seen by anyone and transactions remain unseen. The max supply of CMRA is 300 million tokens.

Only the initial contract creation transaction can be seen. No token transactions or holders can be viewed. To demonstrate, you can see proof of concept on our Etherscan Token Listing.


<p>Token Logistics:</p>
<hr>
CMRA is a private token acting as an alternate form of currency. CMRA will be used for services provided in the future by the developers. It is not in the interest of the developing team to dump tokens for financial gain. The max supply of CMRA tokens is hard-capped to 300 million, with around 30,000 in circulation currently. This will increase as airdrops (and staking in the future) take place.

<p>How to get CMRA?</p>
Air drops will occur periodically, so keep your eyes out on your favorite crypto forums and imageboards for airdrop threads. You can also view our Twitter for airdrop occurrences. As the project progresses, users will be able to purchase CMRA on exchanges.

You can swap tokens into CMRA on Uniswap and Etherdelta. CMRA trade orders can be placed on Etherdelta as of now. More exchanges will be accessible coming soon.

<p>Use cases:</p>
<hr>
  The usability of a private token is vast, and suitable for any industry where privacy while purchasing a product/service is a concern (market trading, adult film/content, military, government, privacy from competitors)

<p>Projects in Development</p>
<hr>
-PrivateFans 
  A content sharing service which allows creators to upload content, and subscribers to pay using CMRA to view said content. Using CMRA provides paperless purchases and anonymous subscriptions to content creators. No cash or credit cards are needed.
-PrivateWallet 
  Web service to provide an added layer of privacy for senders. This service essentially creates middle-wallets and scrambles a user's funds between other middle wallets before being sent to the recipient. On top of the token's privacy standards, this would make token transfers practically untraceable.
