<p>Description:</p>
<hr>
    Chimera (CMRA) is an ERC-20 token that runs privately on the Ethereum blockchain. Its main goal is to remove the transparency seen in typical Ethereum tokens, effectively eliminating transactions being logged by services such as Etherscan. This is to give token holders the advantage of staying anonymous - the wallet address of token holders cannot be seen by anyone and transactions remain unseen. The max supply of CMRA is 100 million tokens.

    Only the initial contract creation transaction can be seen. No token transactions or holders can easily be traced back to the token contract. To demonstrate, you can see proof of concept on our Etherscan Token Listing.

<p>Token Logistics:</p>
<hr>
    CMRA is a private token acting as an alternate form of currency/exchange. CMRA will be used for services provided in the future by the developers. The max supply of CMRA tokens is currently 100 million, with around 1 million in circulation currently. Circulation will increase as airdrops (and staking in the future) take place. Tokens can be minted or burned at the developer's decision (although this won't occur often, if at all).

<p>How to get CMRA?</p>
<hr>
    Air drops will occur periodically, so keep your eyes out on your favorite crypto forums and imageboards for airdrop threads. You can also view our Twitter for airdrop occurrences. As the project progresses, users will be able to purchase CMRA on exchanges.
 
    As of April 11, 2020, the Chimera team is now offering 'bounties' in exchange for CMRA. If you write a review, opinion, or create content such as a short video/images about Chimera, you will be rewarded in CMRA. For more information on this, join the discord and message a moderator.
    
    You can swap tokens into CMRA on Uniswap, Etherdelta, Forkdelta, Saturn Exchange, and most DEX's. More exchanges will be accessible in the future. It is <b>not</b> in the developer's interest to dump tokens: we aim to provide long-term services which token holders enjoy. Tokens sold by developers will only solely be for the purpose of providing basic living needs and project funding (for example, servers or virtal machines).
 
    The Chimera team now also provides a staking bonus. Quantities larger than 50,000 can be staked for a time period, whereafter they're rewarded with a bonus percentage of tokens.

<container>
<p>Use cases:</p>
<hr>
  The usability of a private token is vast, and suitable for any industry where privacy while purchasing a product/service is a concern (market trading, adult film/content, military, government, privacy from competitors)

<p>Projects in Development</p>
<hr>
-PrivateFans <br>
    A content sharing service which allows creators to upload content, and subscribers to pay using CMRA to view said content. Using CMRA provides paperless purchases and anonymous subscriptions to content creators. No cash or credit cards are needed.<br>
-Scram! <br>
    Web service to provide an added layer of privacy for senders. This service essentially creates middle-wallets and scrambles a user's funds between other middle wallets before being sent to the recipient. On top of the token's privacy standards, this would make token transfers practically untraceable.<br>
 -More to come in the future!<br>

 <u>Beginners guide to Chimera:</u>
  
 What is Chimera? A currency? A security? A stake?
	Chimera is an ERC-20 token (Ethereum) aiming to remove the transparency seen in typical Ethereum tokens. The pros and cons for transparency vary from person to person, with some people preferring an asset such as Monero over something like Bitcoin. Chimera is essentially Ethereum's solution to creating an anonymous service on Ethereum's blockchain. Thus, Chimera can be thought of a "private version of Ethereum" - Chimera holds all the capabilities as Ethereum with reduced transparency. As the development team plans to have Chimera be used as a payment method, it can be seen as a currency.
Why buy Chimera?
	As Chimera can be seen as a form of "private Ethereum", anyone who is interested in escaping the transparency of the blockchain to hide large amounts of funds would benefit from Chimera's technology. Using Chimera's services leaves no paper trails, thus giving benefit to those seeking sanction from taxing authorities (although our team does not indorse this). Chimera tokens can also used as forms of payment towards services our team will offer in the future.
What will Chimera offer to holders/buyers?
	Chimera holders get the benefit of not being listed under the token contract address on modern block explorers. Transactions themselves can only be viewed in raw hexadecimal to get the values of transaction functions. This information (reguarily displayed for ERC-20 tokens) has been hidden by our token, as services such as WhaleWatcher.io periodically scan the blockchain for large transactions and announces this information publically. For large coin holders, whale watching services can cause a hurdle. Chimera and it's services aim to surpass this hurdle.
What incentives does Chimera give?
	Chimera can be seen as a private form of Ethereum. It contains all the core functionalities of the Ethereum token, but removes the transparency associated. Using Chimera as a currency provides incentives such as secure and anonymous transfers, a store of value over time, and early access to the products and services the Chimera team will be offering.
How is this different than any other ERC-20 token?
	Chimera differs from most ERC-20 tokens in the sense that the token contract will not display the holders or quantites. This means that making a script/tool to collect the information of token holders is much harder to achieve than regular ERC-20 tokens. If Chimera is sent through it's Scrambler service, it creates a chain of transactions effectively making the time complexity of a script of software exponential rather than linear. The only "easy to see" transactions are from the inital contract creation, minting, and burning.
But wait - can't we still technically see transactions if we look hard enough?
	While block explorers such as Etherscan typically have trouble displaying the "To" address and amount with our token, it is not technically impossible to trace transactions. In contrast, PRIVATE token (A.K.A. Buccaneer Coin) was similar, and their lead developer saw the transparency/tracing problem. In response to this, they "Pump and dumped" their token and proceeded to exit scam. Fortunately, Chimera's goal is to solve the problem PRIVATE failed to: by centralizing transactions before redirecting them appropriately. While more users take part in Chimera's Scrambler, the difficilty of tracing the recipients grows exponentially. As more "middle wallets" are added, the complexity becomes even stronger.
What's in store for the future?
	As of now, we have our first mainnet service working at http://chimera.exchange. This services allows you to further conceal a transfer of funds. 
	Future projects include a crypto-based subscription website for content and media creators. Customers will be able to pay in Chimera or other cryptoassets to unlock media hosted by a creator, essentially creating the most anonymous subscription space to host your photos and videos.
