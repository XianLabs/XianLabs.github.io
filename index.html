<p>Description:</p>
<hr>
    Chimera (CMRA) is an ERC-20 token that runs privately on the Ethereum blockchain. Its main goal is to remove the transparency seen in typical Ethereum tokens, effectively eliminating transactions being logged by services such as Etherscan. This is to give token holders the advantage of staying anonymous - the wallet address of token holders cannot be seen by anyone and transactions remain unseen. The max supply of CMRA is 100 million tokens.

    Only the initial contract creation transaction can be seen. No token transactions or holders can easily be traced back to the token contract. To demonstrate, you can see proof of concept on our Etherscan Token Listing.

<p>Token Logistics:</p>
<hr>
    CMRA is a private token acting as an alternate form of currency/exchange. CMRA will be used for services provided in the future by the developers. The max supply of CMRA tokens is currently 100 million, with around 1 million in circulation currently. Circulation will increase as airdrops (and staking in the future) take place. Tokens can be minted or burned at the developer's decision (although this won't occur often, if at all).

<p>How to get CMRA?</p>
<hr>
    Air drops will occur periodically, so keep your eyes out on your favorite crypto forums and imageboards for airdrop threads. You can also view our Twitter for airdrop occurrences. As the project progresses, users will be able to purchase CMRA on exchanges.
 
    As of April 11, 2020, the Chimera team is now offering 'bounties' in exchange for CMRA. If you write a review, opinion, or create content such as a short video/images about Chimera, you will be rewarded in CMRA. For more information on this, join the discord and message a moderator.
    
    You can swap tokens into CMRA on Uniswap, Etherdelta, Forkdelta, Saturn Exchange, and most DEX's. More exchanges will be accessible in the future. It is <b>not</b> in the developer's interest to dump tokens: we aim to provide long-term services which token holders enjoy. Tokens sold by developers will only solely be for the purpose of providing basic living needs and project funding (for example, servers or virtal machines).
 
    The Chimera team now also provides a staking bonus. Quantities larger than 50,000 can be staked for a time period, whereafter they're rewarded with a bonus percentage of tokens.

<p>Use cases:</p>
<hr>
  The usability of a private token is vast, and suitable for any industry where privacy while purchasing a product/service is a concern (market trading, adult film/content, military, government, privacy from competitors)

<p>Projects in Development</p>
<hr>
-PrivateFans <br>
    A content sharing service which allows creators to upload content, and subscribers to pay using CMRA to view said content. Using CMRA provides paperless purchases and anonymous subscriptions to content creators. No cash or credit cards are needed.<br>
-Scram! <br>
    Web service to provide an added layer of privacy for senders. This service essentially creates middle-wallets and scrambles a user's funds between other middle wallets before being sent to the recipient. On top of the token's privacy standards, this would make token transfers practically untraceable.<br>
 -More to come in the future!<br>
